Further Debugging: If you continue to encounter issues or inconsistencies, consider:

Checking the Git configuration (git config --list) to ensure there are no unusual settings.
Trying git init again if the initial repository setup seems problematic.
Verifying that there are no conflicting Git processes or hooks that might interfere
